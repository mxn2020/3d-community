# Enhanced Virtual Community Project

## Project Overview
A 3D interactive community space inspired by Futurama's visual aesthetic where visitors can purchase plots, select from pre-designed homes with color customization, and connect with others through a points-based social system. The project creates expandable neighborhoods with fixed layouts managed by a super admin.

## Core Features

### World Design
- Futurama-inspired color palette and visual aesthetic throughout the 3D space
- Initial community layout resembling suburban streets outside a major American metropolis
- Fixed landscape elements that only the super admin can modify
- Preservation of established communities as they fill up
- Expandable design allowing super admin to add new community sectors as existing ones reach capacity
- **All UI elements rendered on top of the 3D landscape**, ensuring the landscape remains always visible

### Decorative Objects
- Various tree types with multiple shapes and sizes
- Benches placed throughout community areas
- A central lake feature with animated water effects
- Mailboxes with customizable designs near each home
- Hover Benches with subtle hover animation effects
- Street Lamps illuminating pathways at night
- Hologram Billboards displaying community announcements with animation
- Robot Pets wandering the landscape with playful animations

### Property System
- One purchasable plot per user account
- Selection from multiple house types (expanded from original 5 designs)
- Multiple architectural styles including:
  - Futuristic pod homes
  - Neo-retro bungalows
  - Sky-suspended platforms
  - Underground eco-domes
  - Transparent crystal structures
- Color customization options for each house type
- Purchase management through Stripe integration

### Interactive Community Buildings
1. **Community Center Building**
   - Opens a community board when clicked
   - Users can view and create posts
   - Users can comment on and like posts
   - Features a tabbed interface for browsing and creating content

2. **Directory Building**
   - Allows users to search for plot owners
   - Clicking on a resident navigates the camera to their house
   - Shows resident information including level and house type

3. **Feedback Building**
   - Users can submit bug reports and feature requests
   - Users can upvote/downvote existing requests
   - Shows status of requests (pending, approved, rejected, implemented)
   - Features filtering by status

### Profile & Social Integration
- Interactive houses that display profile cards when clicked
- Customizable profile cards featuring:
  - User name
  - Contact information (email)
  - Social media links
  - Avatar/profile picture

- "Like" system allowing users to appreciate other community members' homes
- Points earned through login activity and receiving likes
- Level progression system with distinctive badges displayed:
  - Above each user's house in the 3D world
  - On user profile cards

### User Experience
- Streamlined authentication process via Supabase
- Simple house selection and color customization interface
- Intuitive navigation throughout the community
- Mobile-friendly design with straightforward controls

### Admin Capabilities
- Super admin panel for landscape management
- Community expansion controls to add new sectors
- Monitoring tools for plot sales and community growth
- Management of the points/level system

## Technical Stack
- Next.js for frontend and backend functionality
- Supabase for authentication and database management
- Stripe for payment processing and plot purchases
- 3D rendering library compatible with Next.js (Three.js or React Three Fiber)

## Development Focus Areas
- Authentication and user management system
- 3D landscape rendering with Futurama-inspired aesthetics
- Super admin control panel for community management
- User actions (plot purchase, house customization, liking)
